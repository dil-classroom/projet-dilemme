Each site page (with a `.md` extention) is a site page. <br>
When you run the [init command](#Commands) `index.md` will be generated, you also can use it as a template to create other site page. <br>
The file is in two parts:
1. The page configuration, where you can configure multiple things:
    - `title`: the page title that will be displayed on the top of the page
    - `author`: the author of website
    - `date`: the date of the page creation (in the format yyyy-MM-dd)
2. The page content, that will be converted to a real HTML page afterward. You can write any content in the [Markdown format](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
This content can include links to other pages, images, videos, etc. Every media file will be copied to the `build` folder.
